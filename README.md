# nc_vel_solver
Nonconvex Velocity Solver for PC-MRI Data

# About
This code is meant to accompany the reconstruction described in "Velocity Reconstruction with Non-Convex Optimization for Low-VENC Phase Contrast MRI"

The velocity solver itself is written in C++, accompanying code to set up the example datasets and run the code is written in Python.
